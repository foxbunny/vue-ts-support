# vue-ts-support

This package provides support tooling for managing a
[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) project build. It is a quick way to get off the
ground, but also a very opinionated one.

## Goals and ideas

The following are the guiding principles behind vue-support:

- One dependency
- Easy configuration
- Easy to fork and extend
- Production-ready

This project is heavily influenced by
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and
[create-cycle-app](https://github.com/cyclejs-community/create-cycle-app).

## Supported technologies

This is a list of supported technologies:

- Webpack 2
- TypeScript (linting and type checking)
- Single-file components
- Autoprefixer

## Installation

Install via NPM:

    npm install --save-dev vue-ts-support
